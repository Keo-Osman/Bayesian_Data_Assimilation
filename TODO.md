A list of possible things to implement (feel free to add any ideas you have here):
1. Unscented Kalman filter.
2. Take R, obs_freq, intitial_belief_error as command line arguments and pass them to model.
3. Carry on trajectory of prior for a short time period. To see how much the observation improved accuracy.
4. Replace Euler's with RK4. 
5. Use ODE solver library.
6. Plot percent error and general model performance statistics over time.
7. Pairs trading model
	1. Version with synthetic data - like we've done so far.
	2. Live data.
8. Volatility with Heston model.
