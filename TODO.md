A list of possible things to implement (feel free to add any ideas you have here):
- Use ODE solver library - IN PROCESS
- Unscented Kalman filter.
- Take Q as command line arguments and pass them to model.
- Carry on trajectory of prior until next observation. To see how much the observation improved accuracy.
- Plot percent error and general model performance statistics over time.
- Pairs trading model
	- Version with synthetic data - like we've done so far.
	- Live data.
- Volatility with Heston model.
